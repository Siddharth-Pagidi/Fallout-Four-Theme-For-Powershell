# How To Get The Fallout 4 Font?
The closest font I found to Fallout 4's terminal font was "Share Tech Mono".

## Steps On Download and Installation
1. Go to: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono
2. Download the font.
3. Extract the files from the .zip file. Keep in mind where the .ttf file is.
4. Open up Windows settings.
5. In the search bar, type "fonts".
6. Click "Font settings".
7. Drag the .ttf file that you got to the area where it says drag and drop. If done correctly, you will see the font appear in the list of fonts in a second.
8. Restart your computer.
9. After that, open Windows terminal.
10. Next, open the Windows terminal settings.
11. Click on your app again underneath the "Profiles" section.
12. Then, click appearance settings.
13. Lastly, go to the "Font Face" option and select "Share Tech Mono" in the list of fonts.

Congradulations! You set up the custom font! :)
