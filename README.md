# Fallout Four Theme For Powershell
This repository will show you how to get the Fallout 4 terminal theme on your Windows Powershell. I give half credit to Lukasedv for the base code.

## Download Windows Terminal
To download Windows Terminal, go to this link: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal
This is the GitHub link so you will need to follow their instructions for installation.

## Navigating To The JSON File
1. First, open Windows Terminal.
2. Then, at the very top, click the drop-down arrow next to the plus sign.
3. After that, hit settings.
4. Next, at the bottom left of the application, you should see 'Open JSON File'. Click on this.
